# About Project

The feedback-app ui is a small feedback application that allows for edit, add, delete and update feedback items. It is a FULL react app that can further be improved if a mock json server is used to immitate a backend where the feedback data will be coming from into the app.

DISCLAIMER: This project was inspired by Brad Traversy from one of his courses on Udemy.
